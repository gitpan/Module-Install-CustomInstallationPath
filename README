Module::Install::CustomInstallationPath

A Module::Install extension that allows the user to interactively specify
custom installation directories


NEW IN THIS VERSION

- This is the initial release


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

To use this module, you will need to install:

- File::HomeDir

You should be prompted to install this module automatically when you run "perl
Makefile.PL".


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you unarchived this
distribution and type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You can control the installation of this module by specifying either
"PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom location),
"INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl directories), or
"INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl directories).

If you make the installation into your own directory, then remember that you
must tell perl where to search for modules before trying to 'use' them. For
example:

  use lib '/home/userid/lib';
  use ext::Module::Install;
  ...
  Check_Custom_Installation();
